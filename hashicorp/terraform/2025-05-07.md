| **[Behavior break in 1.11.x : Unexpected HEAD request in getting provider](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/36987)** (_2025/05/06_) | [![bug](https://img.shields.io/badge/-bug-f7c6c7)](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/labels/bug) [![regression](https://img.shields.io/badge/-regression-e11d21)](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/labels/regression) [![new](https://img.shields.io/badge/-new-c2e0c6)](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/labels/new) | A user reports a behavior change in Terraform 1.11.x, where a HEAD request to a presigned S3 URL results in a 403 error, while it worked in version 1.10.x. This issue arises because the presigned URL is valid only for GET requests. The user suggests disabling the HEAD request option or making it configurable to avoid this problem. They provide a configuration example and express that this functionality should work as it did in earlier versions. |
